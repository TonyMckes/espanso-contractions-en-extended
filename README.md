# espanso-contractions-en

This package adds apostrophes to common english contractions which I copied from [this List on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_English_contractions). I am not a native English speaker. I might have easily overseen Matches that collide with other words. So feel free to open an Issue or a pull request, if you see room for improvement here.
